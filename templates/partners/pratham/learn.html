        The WebBox was designed by the Vodafone Group. It is essentially a smart phone repackaged as a keyboard â€“ serving as a low cost smart class platform. The WebBox has AV cables that plug into a television, which is a part of the hardware package provided to schools. Additionally, it is internet-enabled through a SIM card.
      </p>
      <p>
        The WebBox is equipped with a learning application for the classroom that contains curriculum- aligned digital content. This includes videos, slideshows, and classroom activity ideas that are stored directly on the WebBox and can be used by the teacher both within the classroom and during lesson planning.
